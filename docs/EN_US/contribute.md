###Other important factors to a good contribution

* If you have a **question** about anything in the project, that means: "*is this working properly?*" or "*isn't this way much better?*" and so on... 
We **suggest** you to take a search first, if that doesn't answers your question, you can report an issue or talk about a feature/improvement.
